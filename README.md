Ready-to-use Workspace and Workflow Templates for Onepanel

## Getting started
See [Workspaces](https://docs.onepanel.ai/docs/getting-started/concepts/workspaces) and [Workflows](https://docs.onepanel.ai/docs/getting-started/concepts/workflows) to understand these concepts in Onepanel.

You can then browse the examples in this repository and copy/paste them into your Onepanel instance to try them out.

See the following references for more information on how to build these templates:
- [Workspaces templates](https://docs.onepanel.ai/docs/reference/workspaces/templates)
- [Workflows templates](https://docs.onepanel.ai/docs/reference/workflows/templates)
